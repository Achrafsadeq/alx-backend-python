# 0x01. Python - Async

## Description

This project introduces asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. The tasks are designed to help you understand coroutines, event loops, and how to write concurrent code in Python. By the end of this project, you will be able to write efficient asynchronous code that can handle multiple tasks concurrently.

## Requirements

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Editors | vi, vim, emacs |
| Interpreter | Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7) |
| File Endings | All files should end with a new line |
| Shebang | The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3` |
| README | A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| Coding Style | pycodestyle (version 2.5.x) |
| Executable Files | All files must be executable |
| File Length | The length of files will be tested using `wc` |
| Documentation | Modules, functions and coroutines should be documented |
| Type Annotations | All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated |

## Project Structure

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Write an asynchronous coroutine that waits for a random delay | 0-basic_async_syntax.py |
| 1 | Write a function to execute multiple coroutines concurrently | 1-concurrent_coroutines.py |
| 2 | Measure the runtime of concurrent coroutines | 2-measure_runtime.py |
| 3 | Create a function that returns an asyncio.Task | 3-tasks.py |
| 4 | Modify wait_n to call task_wait_random | 4-tasks.py |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

* Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution
* Use async and await syntax to write coroutines
* Run concurrent coroutines using asyncio
* Measure the performance benefits of asynchronous programming
* Create and manage asyncio Tasks
* Understand how to use random numbers in async functions
* Implement proper type annotations for async functions
* Write documentation for asynchronous code
