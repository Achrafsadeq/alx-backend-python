# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Description

This project builds upon asynchronous programming concepts in Python, focusing specifically on asynchronous comprehensions. You'll learn how to use async generators and comprehensions to write more concise and efficient asynchronous code. The tasks demonstrate how to collect and process data asynchronously while maintaining clean code structure.

## Requirements

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Editors | vi, vim, emacs |
| Interpreter | Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7) |
| File Endings | All files should end with a new line |
| Shebang | The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3` |
| README | A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| Coding Style | pycodestyle (version 2.5.x) |
| File Length | The length of files will be tested using `wc` |
| Documentation | Modules, functions and coroutines should be documented |
| Type Annotations | All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated |

## Project Structure

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Write an async generator that yields random numbers | 0-async_generator.py |
| 1 | Use async comprehension to collect random numbers | 1-async_comprehension.py |
| 2 | Measure runtime of parallel async comprehensions | 2-measure_runtime.py |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

* Understand and implement async generators in Python
* Use async comprehensions to collect results from async generators
* Run multiple async comprehensions in parallel using asyncio.gather
* Measure and understand the performance characteristics of async code
* Explain why parallel async operations can run concurrently
* Write properly documented and type-annotated async code
* Implement random number generation in async contexts
* Create efficient data collection patterns using async features
